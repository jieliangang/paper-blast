### Rules of Game

Clear all the ***coloured bubbles*** and win the game!

After the launched bubble has found a resting position, if it is connected to other identically-colored bubbles and they form a group of 3 or more, that connected group of bubbles is removed from the arena.

After identically-colored bubbles are removed, if there are bubbles that are not connected to the bubbles on the top wall, they will be dropped too.

***Special bubbles***

* **Indestructible Bubble** - Cannot be removed through connecting with adjacent bubbles of the same color. They have to be removed by falling out of the screen.
* **Lightning Bubble** - Removes all bubbles in the same row as it. All hanging bubbles thereafter should also be removed.
* **Bomb Bubble** - Removes all bubbles adjacent to it.
* **Star Bubble** - When a colored bubble comes into contact with the star bubble, all bubbles of that color in the arena will be removed.

***Score system***

Obtained when popped or dropped.
* Colored bubbles - 30 points
* Indestructible bubbles - 20 points
* Special bubbles (excluding indestructible) - 10 points

***Limited number of shots***

50 bubbles to shoot per round. 
You lose if you run out of bubbles to shoot and had yet to clear the game!.

***Game Over***

If you reach the 14th row, you lose automatically! :(

***Two Player Mode***

If you run out of bubbles to shoot, the game ends when the other player clears the game or also run out of bubbles!
Player with the highest score wins!
You can interfer as the bubbles you shoot will collide with the opposite players' bubble!
